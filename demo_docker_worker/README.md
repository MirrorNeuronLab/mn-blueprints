# Docker Worker

Demonstrates one MirrorNeuron feature: **DockerWorker execution**.

Compute and verify a checksum in a minimal Alpine container.

## Quick test

```bash
mn blueprint validate .
mn blueprint run --folder . --offline --fake-llm
```

Default inputs are deterministic and require no GPU, external API, downloaded model, or connector account. Use `config/default.json` to select the `json`, `file`, or `env_json` adapter.

## Expected evidence

The run finishes with `final_artifact.json` plus the standard run-store lifecycle, error, timeline, and observability artifacts. Inspect `workflow_state` and `events.jsonl` for the feature-specific runtime evidence.

## Blueprint package format

This blueprint uses the canonical blueprint/v1 format in both folders and ZIPs.
`manifest.json` contains identity, semantic release version, and document references.
`workflow.json` owns logical topology and policies; `execution.json` owns workers,
resources, and services; `contracts.json` owns input/output and artifact contracts.
Platform descriptors live in `extensions/`, package requirements in
`dependencies.json` when present, and operator defaults in `config/default.json`.
The SDK reads these documents together and compiles the Core execution artifact.
A ZIP contains the same files as the folder. Local overrides and invocation
configuration are resolved by the SDK before launch.
