# General Prime Sweep Scale

A blueprint for general prime sweep scale.

## Operations

### Status logging

Blueprint helper scripts and payloads report important running status as JSON lines on stderr. Each line includes `ts`, `level`, `blueprint`, `phase`, and `message`, with optional `details`. This keeps stdout reserved for bundle paths or machine-readable result JSON.

### Quick test mode

Use quick test mode for cheap logic validation before calling paid or slow external systems:

```bash
MN_BLUEPRINT_QUICK_TEST=1 python3 generate_bundle.py --quick-test
```

Generated blueprints shrink worker counts, durations, retries, and delays. LLM/email/API-facing paths use mock or dry-run providers where supported.

### Output contract

CLI output is intentionally uniform:

- stderr: JSON status lines and ASCII progress bars such as `[########--------] 50% phase`.
- stdout: one bundle path, one JSON object, or MirrorNeuron event envelopes.
- events: typed objects with a `type` and `payload` field.

### Shared skills

Reusable helpers live in `mn-skills` instead of being reimplemented inside blueprints:

- `blueprint_support_skill`: logging, progress, quick-test, and manifest helpers.
- `marketing_email_skill`: deterministic customer segmentation, offer selection, and email rendering helpers.
- `email_delivery_skill`: dry-run/live email and Slack delivery wrappers.
